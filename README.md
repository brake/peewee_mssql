peewee_mssql
============

MS SQL Support for [peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee), lightweight Python ORM (based on [pyodbc](https://code.google.com/p/pyodbc/))

Inspired by [this](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/issues/122) post.

At this moment it's in initial stage and supports [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations. 

May be it has more features, but I have not tested them yet.

For now only tested with python 2.7 and MS SQL Server 2008.

Known alternative (with declared python3 support): [peewee-mssql](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/peewee-mssql)
