peewee_mssql
============

MS SQL Support for [peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee), lightweight Python ORM (based on [pyodbc](https://code.google.com/p/pyodbc/))

Inspired by [this](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/issues/122) post.

At this moment it's in initial stage and can for sure:

1. insert data into a table
2. delete data from a table (single row as well as multiple rows)
3. select data from a table

May be it has more features, but I have not tested them yet.
