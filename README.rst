peewee_mssql
############

MS SQL Support for `peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_, lightweight Python ORM (based on `pyodbc <https://code.google.com/p/pyodbc/>`_)

Inspired by `this <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/issues/122>`_ post.

At this moment it's in initial stage and supports `CRUD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete>`_ operations. 

May be it has more features, but I have not tested them yet.

For now only tested with python 2.7 and MS SQL Server 2008.

Known alternative (with declared python3 support): `peewee-mssql <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/peewee-mssql>`_
